# Contributing to VMware's R&D AI Lab (RAIL)

We welcome contributions from the community and first want to thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vmware/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

Before you start working with VMware's R&D AI Lab (RAIL), please read and sign our Contributor License Agreement [CLA](https://cla.vmware.com/cla/1/preview). If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will prompt you to do so when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ]([https://cla.vmware.com/faq](https://cla.vmware.com/faq)).

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions and not all of them need a Pull request. Contributions may include:

* New features and proposals
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions and giving feedback
* Helping to onboard new contributors
* Other related activities

## Getting started

Each sub-project has its own README.  Please look for "getting started" details there.

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).


### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

1. Check if your code changes will pass both code linting checks and unit tests.
2. Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues and commits.
3. Check the commits and commits messages and ensure they are free from typos.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

When reporting an issue, please be sure to specify which sub-project you're filing an issue against.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to file a GitHub issue.
