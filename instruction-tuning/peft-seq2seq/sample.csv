W: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.

M: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.

W: About what time would you think that they were there?

M: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.

W: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.

M: In fact, yes, as short as that.

W: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?

M: Fifty meters.

W: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?

M: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.

W: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.

W: This week's program Up Your Street takes you to Harrogate, a small town in Yorkshire. Harrogate became a fashionable resort during Victorian times, when people came to take a bath in the mineral waters. Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters. Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open park land right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it?

M: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray.

W: Why the Stray?

M: It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land.

W: Oh, I see.

M: Then, we've changes in farming and in land ownership. The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.

W: And is it protected?

M: Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever.

W: So it will always be park land?

M: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields.

W: I believe it looks lovely in the spring.

M: Yes, it does. There're spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers."

M: I guess not much different from everyone else. I'm interested in sport, and I run about 3 miles every day. I particularly enjoy cross-country running, where you have to run across fields, jump over streams and so on. While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies.

Man: What do you mean?

Woman: Well ..... I don't ... I don't know. It's kind of a strange situation. He was dating this girl ... you know Alex? He was dating her and then he ended up breaking up with her because she was using drugs, and ...

Man: Oh, wow. Well, that was a good thing, right?

Woman: Well, yeah, that was, but now she's really angry with him, and he's having all kinds of problems with her, like last week, she punched him in the face and in the groin at school. Right in front of everyone.

Man: Oh, man! So, what did he do about it?

Woman: Well, um ... she told him that if he said anything to a teacher, to the principal or anyone, she would get her friends to beat him up after school.

Man: Man. This sounds really bad. I mean, you often think of men becoming aggressive toward women, but I guess it can go the other way.

Woman: Yeah, yeah. You don't really think of this, but it happens, so um ...

Man: So, what are you going to do about it?

Woman: Well, first, Brandon said that, um, he was just going to let it go, but you know, he didn't want to cause any more problems ...

Man: Yeah, I can see that.

Woman: Then he decided that if she was doing that to do that to him and get away with it, she'd just do it to the next guy, so he went to the principal and the school police officer and reported everything, and now they're going to press assault charges against her.

Man: So, isn't he worried about what her friends are going to do to him?

Woman: Yeah, but he thinks that the other people in her group were just going along with her. [ Yeah. ] You know, I don't know. We'll see. They're probably frightened of what she might do to them. You know, she'll probably get suspended and have to go to court, but I don't know. He's kind of worried about some backlash.

Man: I mean, people have to realize that you can't inflict violence on others, you know, in any type of relationship or friendship.

W: Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office.

M: I'm not in there very often. It's so noisy that I can't work.

W: That's exactly what I'm getting at. We're supposed to be able to do our preparation in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in and get help with his course.

M: We can't really ask him to stop having students come in for help, can we?

W: No, of course not. But I'm not able to do my work and neither are you. I imagine it's the same for the others in the office.

M: Hmm, could we ask for a kind of meeting room? When we have to talk to students, we could go to the meeting room.

Amanda: Do you remember Chad Phillips?

James: Uh, wasn't he the quarterback on the football team?

Amanda: Right. Well, he married Sarah Rogers, and they are in charge of the event. So, what do you think? Are you going?

James: I don't know. I never really fit in in high school. I was kind of a loner. I also remember asking Sarah out on a date, and she turned me down. She said she was sick, and it turned out she went out with someone that same night. It could be a little awkward.

Amanda: Hey, why don't we go together?

James: Are you sure?

Amanda: Yeah.

James: Well, sure. Why not. To be honest, I always thought you were very nice. I just never had the guts to ask you out.

Amanda: Well, here's your chance.

James: Sounds great. So, what's your number so I can call you?

Amanda: It's 435-923-6017.

James: 6017, Okay. Where do you live?

Amanda: I only live two blocks south of the old high school.

James: Okay. I remember where you live. Let me call you a few days before to confirm things.

Dan: Shh. Quiet. I can see some deer down there, I think. You'll scare the deer away. They have a great sense of hearing and smell, so we have to remain out of sight.

Paul: Well, as you know, I really don't eat much meat ...

Dan: You don't have to eat it. I'll take care of that. Just get ready. As soon as the sun comes up in a few minutes, you can often see the deer down in that meadow. You see that stream down there. [Yeah. ]We just need to quietly get a little closer.

Paul: Uh, Dan. How about if I just wait here and watch, you know, watch our stuff?

Dan: No, man. We'll have a better chance at bagging a deer if we're together.

Paul: Uh, man, I forgot my ammo back at the truck. What a bummer! I guess I'll just have to sit here and watch.

Dan: Are you crazy? Here. Take these shells and load your rifle. Taken 'em. Take 'em.

Paul: Uh. [cough, cough, cough ..] Hey deer. If you're out there, run!

Dan: What are you doing? Cut it out! There's a huge deer now. Ah, he's mine! Watch this!

Paul: Run, Bambi.

Dan: [Bang, bang, bang.] What did you do that for?

Paul: Yes, [looking confused ...] Why are you reloading? They're gone.

Dan: Stand around here for much longer, and you'll see. Any last words?"

W: I started this afternoon. It's great fun reading those wonderful children stories by Doctor Seuss.

M: Doctor Seuss? I don't remember seeing his name on the reading list.

W: His full name's Theodore Seuss Geisel. You can find this name on the reading list. Doctor Seuss is his pen name.

M: I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think.

W: Those stories are also great for classroom use.

M: How's that?

W: Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words.

M: So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again.

W: Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun.

M: Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight."

A: Oh right, well, in that case, I'd advise you to get there early. It opens at 10 o'clock in the morning on weekdays. Look, I think I've got a plan of the place somewhere. Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this.

B: Thanks.

A: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right.

A: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time.

M: How do you feel about flying?

W: I don't mind flying. What I don't like is not being able to keep an eye on my luggage. Whenever the man at the airport hakes my luggage, I never expect to see again.

M: There is always a chance it will fly to Paris while you fly to Rome. Has anything like that ever happened to you?

M: Where did her suitcase get lost?

W: I don't think she ever find out. When she arrived in Europe, her suitcase wasn't there. She had to travel through four countries in the same clothes.

M: I suppose she bought another toothbrush at least. Couldn't she buy another dress?
